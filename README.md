# 🛑 Drowsy Driver Detection using Deep Learning

This mini-project aims to develop a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques. It uses facial landmarks, CNNs, and alert systems to detect signs of fatigue and alert the driver accordingly.Real-time driver drowsiness detection system using Deep Learning (CNN), OpenCV, and Dlib. Detects eye closure and yawning via EAR and MAR. Works in day/night without wearables. Triggers alerts to prevent accidents

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect driver drowsiness in real-time.
- Enhance detection accuracy using deep learning.
- Implement real-time alerts (audio) to warn the driver.
- Ensure the system works in various lighting conditions (day/night).

---

## 🧠 Methodology

- **Feature Extraction**: Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) used to detect eye closure and yawning.
- **Deep Learning Model**: CNN model trained on facial features.
- **Tools Used**: OpenCV, Dlib, TensorFlow/Keras, Haar Cascades, Facial Landmark Detection.
